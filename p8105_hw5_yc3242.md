### Problem 1

First, I created a tidy dataframe containing data from all pariticipants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time.

``` r
# Started with a dataframe containing all file names
study_data = 
  tibble(file_names = list.files(path = "data/", full.names = T))

# Iterated over file names and read in data for each subject and saved them as a data variable in the dataframe
study_data$data =
  map(study_data$file_names, read_csv)
```

``` r
# Tidied data 
study_data =
  study_data %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  separate(file_names, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(arm = str_remove(arm, "data/"),
         id = str_remove(id, ".csv")) %>% 
  gather(key = "week", value = "obs", "week_1":"week_8") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(str_remove(week, "week_")))
```

Next, I made a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
study_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, group = id)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = arm), size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations on each subject over time",
    y = "observation"
  ) +
  facet_grid(~ arm) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = arm), fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", 
               color = "blue", size = 3, shape = 17) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        strip.text = element_text(color = "white", face = "bold")) 
```

``` r
study_data %>% 
  group_by(arm, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, color = arm, type = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  stat_summary(aes(group = arm), fun.y = "mean", geom = "line", color = "blue") 
```

Average observation is similar at starting point week 0 but over time, average observation in control group remains constant while in exosure group is increasing.

### Problem 2

``` r
pb2 = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )
